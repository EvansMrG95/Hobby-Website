              <h2>Roach</h2>
              <p>Roach are small, silver-scaled freshwater fish commonly found in rivers, lakes, and canals across the UK. They are easily recognised by their reddish fins and rounded body. Roach are social fish that often swim in shoals and feed on insects, plants, and small invertebrates. They're a popular target in coarse fishing due to their abundance, willingness to bite, and the light tackle challenge they provide.</p>
